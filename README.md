# Spline Liquid Glass Test

This repository holds **Liquid Glass effect tests** using **Spline** and **react-three/fiber**.

## Overview

This project is a testing ground for creating and experimenting with liquid glass visual effects using:
- **Spline** - 3D design and animation tool
- **react-three/fiber** - React renderer for three.js
- **@react-three/drei** - Useful helpers and abstractions for react-three/fiber
- **Three.js** - JavaScript 3D library

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)  
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DSalischiker/spline-liquid-glass-test.git
   cd spline-liquid-glass-test
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Build the project for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## Dependencies

- **React** - User interface library
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **@react-three/fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
- **@react-three/drei** - Collection of useful helpers for react-three/fiber

## Purpose

This repository serves as an experimental workspace for:
- Testing liquid glass shader effects
- Integrating Spline 3D models with React applications
- Exploring react-three/fiber capabilities
- Creating interactive 3D experiences with glass-like materials
